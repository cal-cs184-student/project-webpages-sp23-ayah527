<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Visualizing Theoretical Physics: Human Traversable Wormholes</span></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Summary: </strong>We render the theoretical physical construct, a wormhole, which connects two distance points in space. We render one large enough to be traversable by humans, though one of this size is likely impossible (or dependent on unknown physical phenomena, such as dark energy).&nbsp;</li>

    <li><strong>Problem Description</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>We are using current knowledge about theoretical physics to construct a visualization of it. In terms of creating this image, the most difficult parts are going to be changing our current ray tracing implementation to support and accurately render two different scenes or images together in accordance with the math from our resources.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The idea was inspired by the film Interstellar, which includes a high quality rendering of a wormhole. Kip Thorne, a physicist, wrote multiple papers on the subject and assisted in the production of Interstellar&rsquo;s renderings. We use his work as a reference.</li>
        <li>Renderings of theoretical physical phenomena have the potential to increase our intuition and understanding of the subject, and attract more students to the subject.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Goals and Deliverables</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Define how you will measure the quality / performance of your system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or quantifying accuracy). It may not be possible to define precise target metrics at this time, but we encourage you to try.</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>We will compare our images to those found in Interstellar and other references online. As we do not have any reference for performance of the program, we do not yet have any objectives in this regard. This will likely change as we begin our implementation and profiling/benchmarking alternatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Through our analysis, some questions we plan to answer are how changing various variables of the rendering would change the appearance of the wormhole, if changing the scenes that the wormhole is in would change the way our model works and its appearance, and how long rendering different kinds of scenes in these conditions take.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>You should break this section into two parts: (1) what you plan to deliver, and (2) what you hope to deliver. In (1), describe what you believe you must accomplish to have a successful project and achieve the grade you expect (i.e. your baseline plan -- planning for some unexpected problems would make sense). In (2), describe what you hope to achieve if things go well and you get ahead of schedule (your aspirational plan).</strong></li>
        <li>We are planning to deliver images of wormholes with a variety of different scenes involved.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>We are hoping to deliver a sequence of images or video going through the wormhole, from one scene into the one visible through the wormhole.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Schedule</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week.</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Week 1:&nbsp;</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Review and solidify understanding of research papers</li>
                <li>Find how to render objects versus possibility of using images in the wormhole</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Week 2:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Augment and modify the renderer to account for the equations listed in the paper&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Week 3:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Test different images and debug</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Week 4:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Write report, finalize images &amp; website</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Resources</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>List what resources, e.g. books, papers and/or online resources that are references for your project. List the computing platform, hardware and software resources that you will use for your project. You have a wide latitude here to use what you have access to, but be aware that you will have to support and trouble-shoot on your platform yourselves. If you are starting from an existing piece of code or system, describe and provide a pointer to it here.</strong></li>
